      We weren’t born into fashion. We built it. Stitch by stitch. Story by story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our journey began not in factories or boardrooms—but with questions. Questions like: what makes clothing feel *real*? Why should design be dictated by trends? What if every thread told a story?
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>VRUKX</strong>, our mission is more than selling clothes. We build identities. Our designs reflect grit, purpose, and voice—for those who move different.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not just our first drop. It’s a statement. A mark. A beginning.

    <p>
      From the heart of ideas to the hands that wear them—this is your story too.
